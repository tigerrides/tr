        <p class="text w3-left-align w3-animate-bottom">Tigerride is a student-run application created to streamline the process of students sharing transportation services to and from the Princeton University campus. Sharing such services allows users to save money, travel more safely, as well as take a step towards a greener environment. Users fill out a simple form to find other users to share rides with, and have the flexibility of requesting to join and leave rides at any time.</p>
