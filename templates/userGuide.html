    <div class="w3-container">
        <p class="text w3-animate-bottom">Tigerride is a student-run application created to streamline the process of students sharing transportation services to and from the Princeton University campus. Sharing such services allows users to save money, travel more safely, as well as take a step towards a greener environment. Users fill out a simple form to find other users to share rides with, and have the flexibility of requesting to join and leave rides at any time.</p>

        <p class="text w3-animate-bottom">Note: All users of tigerride must be Princeton students or faculty members with a valid netID and password because our website utilizes a Central Authentication Service system to make the app safe and reliable for all users.</p>

Click “submit.”
If user is the first to submit a ride in their desired time frame, they are redirected to a page that displays the following message: “We've created a ride for you and we will notify you via your Princeton email when other students join your group!”
User will receive e-mail notifications when others request to join their ride. 
User can either approve or reject requests.
Otherwise, user is redirected to page displaying all open rides that match their search. User can request to join rides. This notifies the other users via e-mail and they will either approve or reject the user. 
If the user does not like any of the existing rides, they have the option to create a new ride of their own.
