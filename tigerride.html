<p>Tired of having your inbox flooded with "uber to EWR?" and "lyft from JFK?" every fall, winter, intercession, and spring break? Tired of being the one to send those emails, to little avail? We introduce our campus solution: tigerride. Tigerride is a student-run application created to streamline the process of students sharing transportation services to and from the Princeton University campus. Sharing such services allows users to save money, travel more safely, as well as take a step towards a greener environment. Through the app, travelers are no longer restricted to those they know and the specific listserv groups they are members of; now, the entire student population has access to find ride-share buddies! Users fill out a simple form to find other users to share rides with, and have the flexibility to join and leave rides at any time. Users can also see other students' profile information to easily connect and communicate, and can create their own profile quickly with TigerBook information, and edit it as preferred. Lastly, we implement a 5-star rating system in order to encourage accountability for all participating riders when it comes to communication, promptness, and responsibility with splitting payments. Ride safely and comfortably, and save money with tigerride!</p>
